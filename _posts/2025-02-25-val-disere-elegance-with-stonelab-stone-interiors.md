### Discover the Unique Qualities of Stone

The natural elegance of stone makes it a preferred choice for countertops, floors, and walls. Here are some of the popular stone types and their unique qualities:

- **Quartz**: Engineered for strength and available in a wide array of patterns, quartz offers both beauty and practicality.
- **Slate**: Its earthy texture and color variations make slate an excellent choice for flooring and accent walls.
- **Limestone and Travertine**: These stones bring a warm and rustic charm, suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications.

From minimalist aesthetics to bold stone patterns, the trends in stone design are as diverse as they are captivating:

- **Minimalist Appeal**: Clean lines and subtle stone textures create a serene and uncluttered space.
