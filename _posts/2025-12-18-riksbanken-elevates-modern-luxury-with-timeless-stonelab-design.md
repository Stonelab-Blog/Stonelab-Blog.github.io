## Selecting the Right Stone for Every Space

Choosing the perfect stone requires a thoughtful approach. Here’s how to ensure your selection suits both function and style:

- **Bathrooms:** Marble bathroom design continues to captivate with its timeless elegance—select a finish that offers both slip resistance and easy upkeep.
- **Living Spaces:** For statement fireplaces or bespoke stone furniture, consider natural stones with unique veining and color variations for visual impact.
- **Outdoor Areas:** Weather-resistant stones, such as slate or porcelain, stand up beautifully to the Nordic climate.

## Caring for Your Stone Surfaces

Preserving the elegance of your exclusive stone interiors is simple with the right care:

- **Regular Cleaning:** Use pH-neutral cleaners and soft cloths to avoid damaging the stone’s surface.
- **Sealant Maintenance:** Reapply sealants as recommended to protect against staining and moisture.
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Steer clear of acidic or abrasive products, especially on marble and limestone.
