title: ### Hannah Brolin Inspired Stone Elegance: Transforming Interiors with StoneLab
---


In the world of interior design, the timeless allure of stone has captivated designers and homeowners alike. Inspired by the "Hannah Brolin" trend, which emphasizes a balance between nature and modern aesthetics, StoneLab Stone Interiors brings the transformative power of stone into homes, creating spaces that are both functional and luxurious.

#### The Allure of Stone in Home Design

Stone has long been a staple in home design, offering durability, elegance, and a touch of nature. Its versatility makes it an excellent choice for countertops, floors, and walls. At StoneLab, we understand the unique qualities of various stone types and their impact on interior aesthetics:

- **Marble**: Known for its classic beauty and veining, marble is perfect for creating a luxurious atmosphere in kitchens and bathrooms.
- **Granite**: Its durability and resistance to scratches make it an ideal choice for high-traffic areas like kitchen countertops.
- **Quartz**: Engineered for consistency and strength, quartz offers a seamless look with minimal maintenance.
- **Slate**: With its earthy tones and texture, slate adds a rustic charm to floors and walls.

#### Current Style Trends

The "Hannah Brolin" trend highlights two prevailing styles: minimalist aesthetics and bold stone patterns. Minimalism focuses on simplicity and functionality, often utilizing neutral stone colors to create a serene environment. On the other hand, bold patterns in stones like marble and granite can serve as statement pieces, adding drama and personality to any room.

#### Practical Advice for Stone Selection

Choosing the right stone for your space involves considering both function and style. Here are some practical tips:

1. **Assess the Space**: Consider the room’s use and traffic. For high-traffic areas, opt for durable stones like granite or quartz.
2. **Consider Aesthetics**: Match stone colors and patterns with your desired design theme.
3. **Think Long-term**: Invest in stones that will stand the test of time in both style and durability.

#### Stone Care and Maintenance

To keep stone surfaces looking their best, regular maintenance is key:

- **Sealing**: Protect porous stones like marble and granite by sealing them annually.
- **Cleaning**: Use pH-neutral cleaners to avoid damaging the stone’s surface.
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals**: Acidic substances can etch or discolor stone surfaces.

#### Sustainable Sourcing and Eco-Friendly Options
