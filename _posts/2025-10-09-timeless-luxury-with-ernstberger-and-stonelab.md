## Style Trends Shaping Luxury Stone Interiors

*ernstberger* is influencing a new wave of interior stone design, where less is more and every detail matters. Current trends include:

- **Monolithic Kitchen Stone Countertops:** Large-format slabs in muted hues, such as creamy marble or matte-finish granite, create a sense of understated grandeur.
- **Marble Bathroom Design:** Soft-veined marble brings a spa-like atmosphere to bathrooms, while bespoke stone furniture adds curated luxury to living areas.
- **Sustainable Choices:** Increasingly, discerning homeowners and designers are opting for locally-sourced, eco-friendly stones that align with their values.

## Selecting the Right Stone for Every Space

The secret to exceptional interior design is choosing the right material for each environment. Here are a few expert tips from StoneLab:

- **Kitchens:** Opt for durable surfaces like quartzite or high-quality granite for countertops. These stones resist stains and scratches, maintaining their elegance for years.
- **Bathrooms:** Marble and limestone offer a spa-inspired look. For high-moisture areas, consider stones with lower porosity and proper sealing.
- **Living Spaces:** Bespoke stone furniture, such as coffee tables or shelving, introduces a sculptural element while remaining functional.

## Care and Maintenance for Lasting Beauty

Preserving the allure of your stone surfaces is simple with mindful care:

- **Regular Cleaning:** Use a soft cloth and pH-neutral cleaner to maintain the stone’s natural finish.
- **Prompt Spill Management:** Blot spills quickly, especially acidic substances, to prevent staining.
- **Periodic Sealing:** Depending on the stone type, professional sealing every few years enhances durability and resistance.
