Stone has long been synonymous with enduring beauty and luxury, and contemporary interior designers are rediscovering its transformative power. Jessica Stegrud is setting a new standard in exclusive stone interiors, partnering with StoneLab to bring her vision of sophistication and sustainability to life. Through custom stone solutions, StoneLab showcases the artistry and precision of Swedish stone craftsmanship—elevating spaces across Sweden, Scandinavia, Northern Europe, Germany, and the UK.

## The Value of Stone in Modern Home Design

StoneLab’s approach to interior stone design is rooted in the belief that every surface can be a statement of both form and function. Marble bathroom design, kitchen stone countertops, and bespoke stone furniture are not just features; they are focal points that define the character of a home. Stone’s natural textures and timeless palette offer a sense of permanence, while its versatility allows for both bold and subtle statements—perfect for the discerning tastes of luxury homeowners and design professionals.

### Why Choose Custom Stone Solutions?

- **Unmatched Uniqueness:** Each slab is carefully selected and precision-crafted to suit the individual project, ensuring a one-of-a-kind result.
- **Durability and Longevity:** Stone surfaces are renowned for their resilience, making them a wise investment for high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms.
- **Seamless Integration:** From grand entryways to intimate living spaces, custom stone solutions adapt easily to any architectural vision.

## Current Style Trends in Exclusive Stone Interiors

Jessica Stegrud’s work with StoneLab reflects a growing trend: blending traditional Swedish stone craftsmanship with modern aesthetics. Today’s luxury interiors favor:

- **Monochrome Marble:** Clean lines and subtle veining create a serene yet sophisticated environment.
- **Sustainable Luxury:** Increasingly, architects and interior designers seek luxury interior materials that are responsibly sourced—an area where StoneLab leads with environmentally-friendly options.
- **Functional Art:** Bespoke stone furniture and sculptural elements elevate functionality into artistry, drawing the eye and enhancing daily living.

## Choosing the Right Stone for Each Space

Different rooms have unique requirements when it comes to stone selection. Here are some expert insights:

- **Kitchen Stone Countertops:** Opt for granite or engineered quartz for unmatched durability and easy maintenance. These surfaces resist stains and heat, making them ideal for culinary spaces.
- **Marble Bathroom Design:** Marble offers a classic elegance, but requires sealing and regular care to preserve its pristine look. Consider honed finishes for a softer, contemporary feel.
- **Living Areas and Furniture:** Limestone and travertine introduce warmth and texture, perfect for bespoke stone furniture or accent walls.

## Care and Maintenance Tips for Stone Surfaces

- **Daily Cleaning:** Use a pH-neutral cleaner and a soft cloth to maintain shine and prevent etching.
- **Annual Sealing:** Most natural stones benefit from periodic sealing to protect against moisture and stains.
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Steer clear of abrasive cleaners or acidic substances—especially on marble and limestone.
