Luxury interiors are as much about material mastery as they are about design vision. Melker Ellborg is a name synonymous with sophisticated interiors, where custom stone solutions elevate spaces to singular expressions of elegance. At StoneLab, we believe the secret to enduring beauty lies in precision-crafted stonework, uniquely tailored for contemporary living and refined tastes.

## The Lasting Value of Stone in Home Design

Stone has long been revered for its natural grandeur, durability, and versatility. Today, exclusive stone interiors are setting new standards for luxury properties across Sweden, Scandinavia, and beyond. Whether it’s the cool sophistication of a marble bathroom design or the bold statement of bespoke stone furniture, the right stone infuses every room with an unmistakable sense of permanence and artistry.

### Current Trends in Interior Stone Design

The latest trends in interior stone design celebrate both boldness and subtlety. Homeowners and designers are gravitating towards:

- **Minimalist slabs**: Large, uninterrupted surfaces in neutral tones for kitchen stone countertops and wall cladding.
- **Textured finishes**: Honed, fluted, or leathered finishes that invite touch and create visual depth.
- **Sustainable selections**: Increasing demand for sustainably sourced stone, reflecting a conscious approach to luxury.

These trends, expertly harnessed by Melker Ellborg and the StoneLab team, blend Scandinavian restraint with international flair—resulting in interiors that feel both timeless and distinctly modern.

## Choosing the Right Stone for Every Space

Selecting the perfect stone is a balance of function, aesthetics, and sustainability. Here are a few practical insights to guide your choices:

- **Kitchen Stone Countertops**: Choose hard-wearing stones such as granite or engineered quartz for durability and ease of maintenance. Opt for neutral tones for a modern, understated look or dramatic veining for a bold centerpiece.
- **Marble Bathroom Design**: Marble exudes classic luxury, ideal for bathrooms and spa suites. Lighter marbles brighten compact spaces, while darker varieties add intimacy and drama.
- **Bespoke Stone Furniture**: For statement pieces, consider unique stone types or finishes that complement your overall interior palette.
- **Sustainable Stone Sourcing**: Always inquire about the origin and ecological impact of your stone. StoneLab is committed to sourcing from responsible quarries and prioritizing materials with minimal environmental footprint.

## Caring for Your Stone Surfaces

Stone is an investment in timeless elegance, and with the right care, its beauty endures for generations. Here are StoneLab’s essential maintenance tips:

- **Seal stone surfaces** periodically to protect against stains and moisture.
- **Clean with pH-neutral products**—avoid harsh cleaners that can etch or dull the stone.
- **Wipe spills promptly**, especially acidic substances like wine or citrus.
- **Use coasters and mats** on kitchen stone countertops to prevent scratches and heat damage.
