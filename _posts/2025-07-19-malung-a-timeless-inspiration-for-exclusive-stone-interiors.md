### Current Trends in Interior Stone Design

The trend towards natural, tactile materials is more prominent than ever. Leading designers and homeowners are embracing the following styles:

- **Bespoke Stone Furniture:** For accent pieces, consider unique stones with distinctive patterns or colors to create conversation starters in living or dining rooms.

### Care and Maintenance for Lasting Beauty

Stone surfaces are an investment in enduring luxury. To preserve their pristine appearance:

- Use pH-neutral cleaners specific for stone.
