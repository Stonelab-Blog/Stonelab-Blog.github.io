---Gert Wingårdh Inspires Contemporary Stone Interiors

Modern luxury interiors are increasingly defined by the fusion of natural materials and sophisticated design. Swedish architect Gert Wingårdh exemplifies this trend through his innovative use of stone, setting a benchmark for elegance and function in exclusive homes across Scandinavia and beyond. At StoneLab, we champion this refined approach—offering custom stone solutions that elevate interiors with timeless appeal and Swedish stone craftsmanship.

## The Enduring Value of Stone in Home Design

Stone is more than a surface; it’s an experience. From the cool touch of marble in a bathroom sanctuary to the stately presence of a bespoke stone kitchen countertop, the right material transforms a room into a statement of taste and quality. Wingårdh’s projects consistently highlight stone’s capacity to anchor spaces with understated grandeur, inspiring StoneLab’s own exclusive stone interiors for luxury homeowners and discerning designers.

### Why Stone Endures in Modern Luxury

- **Natural Variation:** Each slab is unique, adding character and exclusivity.
- **Durability:** Properly sourced and maintained, stone surfaces last generations.
- **Versatility:** StoneLab crafts everything from minimalist kitchen countertops to intricate stone furniture, tailored for any high-end interior.

## Current Trends in Interior Stone Design Across Scandinavia and Northern Europe

In the heart of Sweden and across Northern Europe, including Germany and the UK, today’s luxury interiors are embracing:

- **Soft, Neutral Tones:** Creamy marbles and pale granites for an airy, modern feel.
- **Sculptural Stone Furniture:** Bespoke pieces that double as art.
- **Textured Finishes:** Honed and leathered surfaces add subtle tactility.
- **Sustainable Sourcing:** Increasing demand for responsibly quarried stone with minimal environmental impact.

StoneLab’s custom stone solutions reflect these trends, balancing contemporary aesthetics with the warmth and authenticity that natural stone brings to exclusive interior design in Scandinavia and beyond.

## Choosing the Perfect Stone for Every Space in Luxury Homes

Selecting the right stone requires considering both visual impact and functional needs:

- **Kitchen:** Opt for dense, low-porosity materials like granite or engineered quartz for kitchen stone countertops—easy to clean and resistant to stains.
- **Bathroom:** Marble remains iconic for its elegance, but StoneLab also offers alternative luxury interior materials with enhanced water resistance for marble bathroom design.
- **Living Areas:** Statement walls or bespoke stone furniture can be crafted from a variety of stones, including local Swedish varieties prized for their sustainability.

**Tip:** Always request samples and view them in your own space, as light and surroundings can affect the stone’s appearance.

## Care and Maintenance Tips for Timeless Beauty of Stone Interiors

To preserve the pristine allure of your stone interiors:

- **Daily Cleaning:** Use a soft cloth and pH-neutral cleaner.
- **Sealant:** Annual resealing is recommended for porous stones like marble.
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Steer clear of acidic or abrasive products to maintain the finish.
- **Wipe Spills Promptly:** Especially on kitchen stone countertops to prevent staining.

StoneLab provides expert guidance on care, ensuring your investment endures beautifully.
