Stone has long held a place of honor in the design of refined interiors, celebrated for both its enduring strength and captivating beauty.

Inspired by the elegance and innovation seen in settings like Björn Frantzén’s acclaimed restaurants, StoneLab brings custom stone solutions to those who appreciate the finest in exclusive interior stone design.

## The Enduring Value of Stone in Modern Interiors

Contemporary design trends in Scandinavia and beyond are redefining luxury through balance: blending natural materials with modern aesthetics, and infusing interiors with both warmth and sophistication. Stone is uniquely positioned to deliver on this vision, offering:

- **Timeless Appeal:** Whether it’s a marble bathroom design or bespoke stone furniture, the nuanced textures and colors of natural stone provide a foundation that transcends seasonal trends.
- **Versatility:** From kitchen stone countertops to statement fireplace surrounds, stone adapts beautifully to both classic and contemporary spaces.
- **Sustainability:** Increasingly, discerning homeowners and architects seek luxury interior materials that are not only beautiful but responsibly sourced.

## Current Trends in Exclusive Stone Interiors

This year, several style directions are shaping the use of stone in high-end interiors:

- **Monolithic Statements:** Large-format stone surfaces, such as expansive kitchen islands or seamless bathroom vanities, create a dramatic focal point while highlighting Swedish stone craftsmanship.
- **Textural Contrast:** Combining polished and honed finishes within a single space adds depth and visual interest—a trend gaining traction among interior designers in Scandinavia and the UK.
- **Earth-Inspired Palettes:** Subtle veining and organic hues continue to gain favor, especially in sustainable stone sourcing projects that echo the Nordic landscape.

## Selecting the Right Stone for Every Space

Choosing the ideal stone for your project involves both aesthetic and practical considerations. Here are some expert tips from the team at StoneLab:

- **For Kitchens:** Opt for durable, low-porosity materials such as granite or quartzite for kitchen stone countertops. These surfaces resist staining and wear, making them perfect for culinary environments inspired by the precision of top chefs.
- **For Bathrooms:** Marble remains a popular choice for luxurious bathroom spaces. Select a finish and sealant that maintains water resistance while showcasing the stone’s natural beauty.
- **For Living Areas:** Incorporate bespoke stone furniture or accent walls to add architectural interest and a sense of permanence to open-plan living spaces.

## Caring for Your Stone Surfaces

Maintaining the beauty of your exclusive stone interiors is simpler than you might expect. Follow these easy guidelines:

- **Daily Care:** Use a soft cloth and a pH-neutral cleanser to keep surfaces spotless.
- **Preventative Measures:** Always use trivets or coasters under hot items to avoid thermal shock, especially on marble or limestone.
- **Periodic Sealing:** Depending on the type of stone, reapplying a sealant every few years helps maintain water and stain resistance.
